  <section class="overview">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The capybara is the world's largest living rodent, native to South America. Its name comes from the Tupi language meaning "grass-eater," and it's scientifically known as Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris. They're related to guinea pigs and rock cavies.</p>

  <section class="physical-characteristics">
    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Capybaras have barrel-shaped bodies with reddish-brown fur that turns yellowish underneath. Adults measure 106-134 cm in length, stand 50-62 cm tall, and typically weigh 35-66 kg, with females being slightly heavier than males. They have webbed feet, vestigial tails, and teeth that grow continuously.</p>

      <p>These semiaquatic mammals live near water bodies throughout South America (except Chile) in forests, savannas, and wetlands. They're excellent swimmers who can hold their breath for up to five minutes and are highly social, living in groups of 10-20 individuals that can expand to 100 during dry seasons.</p>

    <h2>Diet and Reproduction</h2>

    <p>Capybaras are herbivores that primarily eat grasses and aquatic plants. They practice autocoprophagy (eating their own feces) to aid digestion. Mating occurs only in water, with a gestation period of 130-150 days producing litters of around four young. Their lifespan is 8-10 years in captivity but typically only four years in the wild due to predation.</p>

  <section class="human-interaction">
    <h2>Human Interaction</h2>
    <p>Capybaras aren't threatened and have adapted well to urbanization. They're hunted for meat and hides in some areas but are also farmed and kept in zoos. They've become popular in internet culture and memes, particularly in the 2020s, and have gained symbolic significance in social movements.</p>
